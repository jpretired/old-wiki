This page provides some general descriptions of the {{wt}} administration area.

== How to administer your webtrees installation ==
To access the administration area, you first need to be logged in as a user with either the role of "administrator" (usually the user you first created when setting up {{wt}}) or "manager". Once logged in you will see a "Control panel" option under the '''My pages''' menu in the main header of the site.
&lt;span style="color:#009000">[NOTE: A "manager" will see a very limited range of administration options, related only to the family tree for which they have been assigned that role.]&lt;/span>

[[File:Admin1.jpg|center]]

== Administration page layout ==
The administration page has three main areas:
* The '''header''' which has some links back to the main installation; different languages and logout.
* A list of '''menus'''. These are used to access the many configuration options available to you.
* The '''content''' area where each page of configuration options will be displayed as you select from the menu list. On first arriving at the administration area this displays a summary of your current version of {{wt}} and a brief welcome message. &lt;b style="color:green;">However, this is an IMPORTANT area, as it will change to give you notification when a webtrees upgrade is available.&lt;/b> REMEMBER, we encourage you to upgrade whenever a new release is available. New versions contain changes in code affecting operations &lt;u>and security&lt;/u>, as well as bug fixes.
There are also other information panels here that you can select for more information. Normally these are 
# '''Users''': A summary of the number and types of user you have registered on each family tree you have installed
# '''Family trees''': Some key statistics about each of your family trees

[[File:Admin2.jpg|center]]

== Menus ==
The menu is divided into groups or categories: Website; Family trees; Users; Media; Modules.
&lt;span style="color:#009000">[NOTE: some users do not realise that the title of each of those groups has submenus and links to a key configuration page which will then appear in the content area.]&lt;/span>
The page or configuration page you are viewing will be highlighted in the menu list.

Each of these groups will explained more detail later, but this is a summary of their general purpose:

==== Website ==== 
Accessible ONLY to users with the role "administrator". These are all options that display or configure features that affect the entire site. (See details below)

==== Family trees ====
The link "Family trees" is only accessible to users with the role "administrator". This provides the features to upload/download and delete family trees.
The links below (''in italics'') to each individual tree are also accessible to users with the role "manager" FOR THAT SPECIFIC TREE. They each provide a large range of configuration options related to a single family tree.

==== Users ====
The Users link itself provides a list of all users (site wide) and the ability to edit their account details. 
Below that are a set of other user related pages with (hopefully) self-explanatory titles.

==== Media ====
The media page gives access to all media objects across the site. They can be listed, edited, deleted, and moved using options on this page, and individual objects can be uploaded.
There is then a separate page for uploading small batches of media objects all at the same time.

==== Modules ====
The top-listed "Modules" link provides a list of all modules available on your site within the Current area. From here they can be listed, enabled or disabled to suit your needs. All changes made here apply site wide though.
Below this are pages where you can configure the display, accessibility, and in some cases position of each separate type of module (Menus; Tabs; Blocks; Sidebar; and Reports).








&lt;hr>

== '''Website''' ==

=== Site configuration / Email configuration ===
This section of the Administration page covers two divisions, Site Configuration and Mail Configuration, each with its own tab. The first feature (Site configuration) allows you to review and make changes to various site configuration options chosen during initial setup.
You can 
# change your data directory to outside your public access folders (although this should not be necessary);
# adjust your memory limit, up to the limit defined within your master PHP.ini file. Settings for an amount higher than your PHP.ini settings should be ignored but may cause system problems;
# adjust your PHP time limit on scripts. Settings for a period of time longer than your master PHP.ini setting should be ignored but may cause system problems;
# change your message storage options;
# change your account registration option for visitors;
# change your account registration approval method. Use caution as setting this value to NO means a new account need not be reviewed and approved prior to a new person accessing your site.
# allow your users to change themes within their own account settings;
# select the overall site's default theme for visitors;
# allow visitors and registered users to switch family trees if your site offers multiple trees;
# change your session timeout. Set in seconds, this will auto-log off a user who fails to physically log out.
# set your preferred site's URL if multiple URL's exist (see help);
# set your Login URL. See the help, but in most cases, this field should remain blank.

The second feature (tab - Mail configuration) allows you to select the type of e-mail communications method you wish to use. This may depend upon the capabilities and tools enabled by your server host. 
You can
# select Messages and choose to send via PHP mail (if enabled), send via SMTP, or send no messages from within the system;
# enter your SMTP server name, or for PHP mail, the name of your domain;
# enter your SMTP server port for outgoing mail, either Port 25 (if enabled) or perhaps Port 587. Configuration will resemble your standard email client or mail server instructions (GMail, Yahoo, MSN, etc);
# enter the password for your e-mail account (again, what you would do for your e-mail client to use this account);
# select your server's security method (usually none, but if required - ssl or tls);
# enter a valid FROM email account (for either PHP or SMTP mail);
# enter valid SENDER email account. This may likely be the same address as the previous entry. An entry is required for the system to work properly.
Visit the [http://www.webtrees.net/index.php/en/forum/ webtrees.net] forum and use search to find and review unique or unusual discussion on related topics.

=== Logs configuration ===
This feature allows you to review most changes logged to the administrative logs. A filter option allows reviewing specific types of activity. Details of changes of family tree data are logged in the '''FAMILY TREES > Changes Log''' section and not here.

=== README documentation ===
The README contains many important instructions on installation and setup.

=== PHP information ===
Much like an INFO.php file but far more secure, using this feature allows you to see both your Master and Local PHP.ini settings.

=== Site Access Rules ===

This feature replaces the previous "Manage sites" option, and was written because the developers get lots of emails from people asking for updates to webtrees to block a certain robot that is causing problems on their site. This lets them do it for themselves.

'''There is no requirement to do anything with this option'''. It was designed so that webtrees will work perfectly if you just ignore it. It is not recommended that you delete the default universal browser access rules as you will simply block access to your site from standard browsers. But if you want to actively manage things, you'll want to start by finding out a little more information about each of your "unrecognised visitors":

# Use whois.net to find out who owns the IP address
# Use user-agent-string.info to find out a little more about the user-agent string.
# Check your webserver logs to see if it visits too frequently, and what sort of requests it makes.

After a period of use the page will appear like this:[[File:Access-rules-2.jpg|center|frame]]

The top half of the page are the rules that are in place. In this case, some are the defaults that come with webtrees and allow "normal" browsers to access the site; and the others are rules added later.

The bottom half are the "unrecognised" visitors that '''might''' require a rule creating later to manage their access.

What you do with this information depends on how aggressively you want to restrict access to the site.

Remember also that user-agent strings are easily faked. Anyone can send a request with a UA string of:
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +www.google.com/bot.html)

Most robots are harmless. They only tend to cause problems when they visit too frequently, and consume too many server resources.

But it is important to identify them. For example, we don't want them to have access to the calendar page. By following the links, they would end up with an almost infinite number of pages.

So, here are a few examples of personal "rules":

*I use the w3validator service to check that webtrees is generating error-free HTML. It needs to be able to see all the pages, and I trust it just to visit pages that are specifically requested. It sends the UA "W3C_Validator/1.3" and uses lots of different IP addresses, but whois.net tells me that they are all owned by MIT, and are part of the netblock 128.30.0.0 to 128.30.255.255. So, I set that particular UA and IP range to "allow", so that they can see the same page that a real visitor would see.

*My ISP (TalkTalk) has an annoying habit of following me everywhere. Whenever I visit a site, they pass my request to a monitoring company who visits the same page 30 seconds later. They claim they are checking for malware, but being sceptical/paranoid, I don't necessarily believe them. Hence 62.24.222.131 and 62.24.222.132 are blocked, whatever UA they send.

*Like most of you, I get lots of hits from the googlebot. Instead of allowing this globally, I just allow it from addresses in its netblock - having first checked that it does actually belong to google. So I set a "robot" rule for 66.249.64.0 - 66.249.95.255 - Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +www.google.com/bot.html). This way, if another robot tries to impersonate google, I'll know about it - and will probably block them for it.

I find that lots of robots ignore my robots.txt file, and hence appear in my "unrecognised visitors" list. Ignoring robots.txt *could* be reason enough to block them. But for the moment, I'm just monitoring my logs, and will only block them if they start misbehaving or causing problems. At the moment, though, I'm mostly collecting information and monitoring my logs.

=== Cleanup data directory ===

This feature allows you to remove certain files from your data directory that are unnecessary or dated. There is no longer a need to keep a copy of your family tree data (GEDCOM) within this folder as all data is now retained within the SQL and this file is quickly dated should you make any changes and therefore does not provide a backup.


&lt;hr>

== Family trees ==

==== General ====
Click on "Family trees", and you will see a page that will vary according to whether you have an family tree installed, and whether you have one or more tree. It is also the page you will be taken when you first complete the {{wt}} installation process. The following image shows a typical page with a single tree installed.
[[File:Admin4.jpg|center|frame]]

The page has two parts, an upper area where existing trees are listed, and a lower panel where a new tree can be created or added.

In the upper section there will be a panel as shown in the image here for each tree on your site. For each tree there are five options:

* '''Export:''' This will create a GEDCOM file from your database, and save it, using the name displayed in this section, in your webtrees/data folder. It will be your complete GEDCOM file, and has no options to limit records for privacy or any other purpose.

* '''Import:''' Use this option to import a GEDCOM file into your database after you have first uploaded it to your webtrees/data folder. This is usually only necessary for GEDCOM files that are too large for your website's PHP file upload limit (often set by your web host to 2MB). When you import a file, you will be warned that doing so will over-write ALL your GEDCOM data that already exists. &lt;span style="color:#009000">[NOTE: Once the import is completed you should delete the GEDCOM file from your /data folder. It is not going to be used or updated at any time by {{wt}}', and can be re-created by using the "export" function should you ever need it]&lt;/span>

* '''Download:''' Like "Export", the Download function will create a new family tree file (GEDCOM) from your database. However, rather than place a complete, no-privacy copy of your family tree onto the server, it will download the file to your local computer, configured with several options. These options include: saving the file as a "zip' file; limiting the data to that allowed based on various user types (visitor, member, manager) according to your privacy configurations, and several other options.

* '''Upload:''' Very similar to "import" but more useful for smaller files. In this case you do NOT need to upload your file to the webtrees/data folder first. It can be uploaded from any location on your desktop computer. Also, the file itself uploaded directly to the database, so no copy is stored on your web server, so there is nothing to delete on completion. This is the best option to use if your server can accept the file size (perhaps less than 5MB on many servers).

* '''Delete:''' This option is used only to completely remove a family tree from your site. All data for this tree will be erased from your database. Therefore, '''use it with caution'''. If the tree is important, make sure you have a backup first, by using either the "export" or "download" options.


'''Create a new family tree'''

The lower section of this page provides an option creates a new family tree. If you have just done a fresh {{wt}} installation, you will create your first family tree using this option. If you have an existing GEDCOM (family tree file), you will import it '''after you create a new tree''', replacing the placeholder information first created. The name you give your tree will be used to generate URLs and filenames, so you should choose something short, simple, and avoid punctuation and spaces. If you want future exports to include a ".ged" (or any other) suffix, then you should included that in the name you use here.

While this name cannot be easily changed after creation, it is '''NOT''' the display name for your family tree. Your display name is easily created and / or changed at any time within the family tree configuration section. As an example, you may enter "kennedy" or "kennedy.ged" for the family tree name, but enter "The Robert F Kennedy Family Tree" in the family tree title section. One has nothing to do with the other.

Once a tree has been created, you will be able to upload or import data from a GEDCOM file using the upload or import options described above. For each new tree you wish to add, you should follow this same procedure; Create > Import > Configure/Manage. {{wt}} does not require you to import a family tree file (GEDCOM). You may begin a new family tree without a GEDCOM (from scratch) by creating the new tree, then modifying the data (name, birth, etc) of the sample individual generated in the new "Family Tree". Go to the Home page, select and edit the new sample individual shown there, then add this individual's relatives.
&lt;br style="clear: both" />

=== ''Your family tree'' ===
There will be a link here for each family tree you create on your site. Clicking one of these links will display a set of tabbed pages where many aspects of the use, access, and appearance of each family tree can be configured.
[[File:Family_trees.png|center|frame]]
&lt;br style="clear: both" />
There exist extensive configuration (preference) options under each of these tabs. These preferences can dramatically effect the look and feel of your site and the functionality of the many tools available to your users. It can control access, modify forms, add fields and restrict editing. You should review each of these tabs so as to become familiar with the options available in managing your {{wt}} site. Help is available for many options to describe their function and their number is too great to provide descriptions here.

=== Merge records ===
[[File:Merge 1.jpg|right|frame]]One of the most commonly asked questions for any family history program is how to  merge two family tree (GEDCOM) files together.

{{wt}} has an excellent merge function (Administration -> Family trees -> Merge records) but it applies only to single instances of the key record types: INDI, FAM, SOUR, and NOTE. Each record to be merged can either exist in the same family tree, or two separate family trees installed on the same {{wt}} site. This function presents, in a side-by-side panel comparison, a method by which to you can select which facts to retain when you merge the data (see image, right). This procedure is available only to family tree managers and administrators as it is quite powerful and destroys the previous independent information.

[[File:Merge1.jpg|center|border]]

To merge entire family trees (GEDCOMs), you must use other available utilities outside of {{wt}}. To be frank, trying to successfully  merge two different data sets is very difficult. {{wt}} does not currently have this ability, nor is it planned as a module for addition later. The algorithms necessary to compare each data set and attempt to make intelligent decisions about the duplicity of the information are quite complex and subject to interpretation. This is especially true when considering the possibility that each family tree may vary widely in the formatting of the original data (different conventions) as well as the quality and quantity of information available on each person, family, place, event and source listed within each family tree. The output may require much more work to confirm that the important data was transferred to the resultant family tree and in cleaning up the formatting thereof (names capitalized, places incomplete, etc.).

There are utilities available on the PC platform, with [http://www.genmerge.com/ GENMERGE] being one of the most recognized, and on the MAC platform, [http://www.geditcom.com/ GEDITCOM], which do an excellent job of combining family trees. However, combining trees is much easier (and perhaps still a bad idea due to formatting differences) than is a true match and merge process. As a result of the factors noted above, {{wt}} does not recommend merging family trees.
&lt;br style="clear: both" />
=== Add unlinked records ===
[[File:Unlinked-1.jpg|right|top|frame]]This option allows administrators (only) to add individuals, sources, or shared notes to the database that are not linked (cross-referenced) to any other record in the family tree.
This can be a useful feature in certain circumstances, but needs to be used with caution. It would be very simple with the tool, to create a very "messy" family tree with large numbers of unconnected, hard to find, records. This is why access to the tool is limited to site administrators.
&lt;br style="clear: both" />

=== Check for errors ===

This replaces and updates the old "gedcheck.php" module. You can now check your database online! No need to export to a file first, no need to accept pending changes first. It's been rewritten from scratch, and only reports on serious issues.

Access it from the Administration screen as shown here. Then select your family tree (if you have more than one) and click "Check for errors". 

The results will be displayed on the same page, following a brief "Key" or explanation of the major types of errors. At present these are:

# ''These errors may cause problems for webtrees.''
# ''These warnings may cause problems for other applications.''

Other types may be added later. If you have no errors, a simple message "No errors were found." will be shown.

Any errors highlighted as "may cause problems for webtrees" should be fixed immediately. Each error will include a brief explanation of the problem, and a link to the record that needs correction.

Errors highlighted as "may cause problems for other applications" are not important to the smooth operation of webtrees. Generally they will be records that use "unofficial" GEDCOM tags that not all software will recognise. There are a very small number of those in webtrees itself, but you might have imported some from a previous software product. In most cases webtrees will try and often succeed in importing and displaying the elements, but you cannot be sure that any other software will. We therefore recommend you review these and try to replace them with a more correct standard GEDCOM specified item. You can get help on these from the webtrees.net forum pages.

If you have webtrees configured to hide the display of GEDCOM errors (Administration -> ''your family tree'' -> Hide &amp; Show -> General - GEDCOM errors) then these tags might not appear on your display. Therefore we suggest you enable the display of these errors if this tool indicates you have such issues to review.
&lt;br style="clear: both" />
&lt;hr>

== Users ==
The '''Users''' menu title is a link itself and it provides a list of all users (site wide) and the ability to edit their account details. This user list has a filter function in the upper-right portion of the header which can help you winnow your list. The small + plus symbol at the left side of each user line will expand the user configuration options. It is important to review every option and set a value according to your desire to limit a user's access and set their personal individual (INDI) and pedigree record IDs so that not only will the user be presented with their own MyPage preconfigured with their account access and individual record page, but other charts and relationship privacy as well.

Below the main "User" menu link, there are a set of other user related pages with (hopefully) self-explanatory titles.

[[File:Users_account_settings1.jpg]]

[[File:Users_account_settings2.jpg]]

====Set the default blocks====
It should be noted that setting the default blocks does not reset existing users, but rather applies only to new users added after you set the default. A default setting is provided, but this is an important feature to review and you may wish to modify the blocks available for your users.

== Sitemaps ==
Sitemaps are a way for webmasters to tell search engines about the pages on a website that are available for crawling. All major search engines support sitemaps. For more information, see www.sitemaps.org. Use this administrative page to select which of your trees (if you have several, each has a tick box, to include in your site's sitemaps. After ticking the boxes you wish included, click SAVE.

Our Sitemaps module creates them dynamically, when a search engine needs them, based on the URL you put in your robots file. This is great, as it means search engine's ALWAYS get the very latest version of your data. It also means it is a "set and forget" process. It also applies updated privacy restrictions and breaks up your site into small, easy-to-handle xml files for the search engines to review.

Please review the Administrative > Sitemaps page for the specific instructions and text for your site. Use the section near the bottom:
To tell search engines that sitemaps have been generated for your site and are now available, you should add the following line to your robots.txt file.
''Sitemap: http://your-webtrees-site-domain/module.php?mod=sitemap&amp;mod_action=generate&amp;file=sitemap.xml''

Visit each search engine's sitemap instructions page to determine how to request they begin using your new sitemaps. The current URLs are linked at the bottom of this Administrative > Sitemaps page.
