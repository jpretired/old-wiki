This <b>Users Guide</b> is intended to introduce novices to <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Webtrees&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Webtrees (page does not exist)">webtrees</a> (or <b>WT</b> for short) so they get comfortable using the program on a day-to-day or more occasional basis for their genealogical research. The Guide aims to provide information about how to use webtrees from the basics to some more advanced features.  Most importantly, it serves to gently introduce the processes and steps to accomplish specific tasks.  More a tutorial and overview than reference manual.
</p><p>This guide is aimed at researchers and editors and not the casual public visitor who does not login nor the administrator who is managing more advanced capabilities. Some features of webtrees can only be modified by the site administrator and are detailed in the <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Administrators_Guide&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Administrators Guide (page does not exist)">Administrators Guide</a>.  Online help via the many question mark symbols (insert symbol here yet) can aid the casual visitor as well as novice user to navigate the program.
</p><p>We start with a Quick Start Guide and overview, followed by more detailed User Tutorials and procedures.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Quick_Start_Guide">Quick Start Guide</span></h2>
<p>Provided here is a brief overview to get the new <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Webtrees&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Webtrees (page does not exist)">webtrees</a> user off to a flying start. At the top of each main heading is a link to more detail for that step.  For those who are experienced with similar software, skip directly to the detail in the link.  For users new to webtrees and genealogy programs in general, read through the quick start completely before jumping down the rabbit hole of links.  This to first get an overall feel of important points about the setup and flow.  Once done, then go back through and hit the detailed pages to get a step by step introduction of how to do a specific task.
</p>
<h3><span id="Starting_a_New_Tree_/_GEDCOM"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Starting_a_New_Tree_.2F_GEDCOM">Starting a New Tree / GEDCOM</span></h3>
<p>What layman call a <b>Family Tree</b> is often termed a "<a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=GEDCOM&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="GEDCOM (page does not exist)">GEDCOM</a>" or Genealogical Database in <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Webtrees&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Webtrees (page does not exist)">webtrees</a> and to genealogists.  Each <b>Family Tree</b> or database in a webtrees installation is stored in its own GEDCOM file. A tree is possibly misleading and represents a myopic view of the relations of people over generations from one persons perspective.  Like a banyon tree, as soon as there is a large enough group of people each with their own view, it is no longer easy to determine a starting trunk or source.  It is a dense forest of interconnections.  Hence database, web or mesh of individuals is a more correct term overall to represent what you are creating here.  But the terms are used interchangeably in this guide and often the software to help ease the casual user into using the system.
</p><p>You can either start from scratch or import work done previously in another program.  Those with experience in some other genealogy program can often export the data from there into a GEDCOM file.  Once available, the work can then be imported into webtrees to start where you left off.  Similarly, the webtrees can be archived or exported to a GEDCOM file for loading into some other program elsewhere.  Just remember that the GEDCOM file captures the facts but only hints at links to media.  A user has to separately handle media files that may have been attached. Otherwise, if starting from scratch, the administrator will have to start a new GEDCOM to allow a new tree.  Once available, you can begin entering new data on people, places and families.  See the main article on how to perform these tasks.
</p><p>Once you have a tree or database, you have to start adding or editing information.  Information in webtrees and GEDCOMs in general revolves around two major objects: <b>Individuals</b> (or People) and <b>Families</b>.  Additional supporting objects are <b>Place Hierarchy</b>, <b>Media</b>, <b>Sources</b> and <b>Repositories</b>.  To remind yourself of these objects later, look under the main <b>Lists</b> pull down menu in webtrees.  
</p><p>Important secondary facts associated with most objects or facts are dates and places.  Just realize there is a lot of freedom and flexibility in what you enter.  But the more precise and following of conventions, the better the program can automatically process the data for you.  So later on click through the links on these two important facts to learn these important conventions.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="People_and_Families">People and Families</span></h3>
<p>Most genealogical software, as does <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Webtrees&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Webtrees (page does not exist)">webtrees</a>, strive to avoid islands of disconnected people in the database.  Therefore, you are restricted to adding people who are related to people already in your database.  Further, the connections between people are made inside and through a <b>Family</b>.  People become related by how they relate inside a Family.  Some term this the immediate family.  In <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Webtrees&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Webtrees (page does not exist)">webtrees</a>, they are known as <b>Relatives</b> as there are usually two and sometimes more immediate families an Individual may be a part of.
</p><p>Most people become part of two families in their lifetime.  A child in their parents family and, when they marry and have children, as a parent of their own family.  Philanders and others may create many more families, whether intentional or not.  Note that the concept of a family is not the same as a household.  In databases such as these, there is a historical focus on biological relationships with a more recent one of legal relationship through adoption or religious connection available as well.  So unless adopted, a young child raised by a step-parent will never appear associated with or in the same family as the step-parent.  Something to keep in mind when recording individuals, families and their relationships.
</p>
<h3><span id="Adding/Editing_People_and_Families"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Adding.2FEditing_People_and_Families">Adding/Editing People and Families</span></h3>
<p>To add a new person, add a close relative to an existing person in the family tree. Generally one adds a spouse, father, mother, or child. A new person can be added in the <b>Close Relatives</b> tab on the <b>Individuals</b> screen, or from a <b>Family</b> screen by clicking to add a child, husband or wife.  Adding a child, father, mother or spouse will create the new family if it did not exist already.  This because the relationship has to be created when adding the new person and a relationship only exists within a family.  
</p><p>Adding a new spouse will create a new family with the two individuals as parents.  A problem arises when trying to add a new sibling before the family exists.  It takes a spousal or parent-child relationship to create the family.  So even if nothing is known about either parent, one must create at least one parent first to add a sibling.  In such cases, create the parent with "Unknown" as their first and last name as a place holder.  Later on, the parent can be edited to correct information when known.  
</p><p>There is a distinction between adding someone NEW versus making a link to someone who already exists in the database.  Most often you are adding new but occassionaly you may need to link to an existing person.  The need arises when distant cousins marry or siblings in one family marry different siblings in another family.  
</p><p>See the main page on <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Editing_People&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Editing People (page does not exist)">Editing People</a> or <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Editing_Families&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Editing Families (page does not exist)">Editing Families</a> for specifics on each form to add a new or link to an existing Individual.
</p><p>Rarely there is a need to add an unlinked person first, for example, if you are working on a separate branch that might eventually get connected. While possible, it is purposely inconvenient, requires Administrative privileges, and can only be done from inside the Administrator screen (see <a href="../Add_an_unlinked_person.html" title="Add an unlinked person">Add an unlinked person</a>).
</p><p>When you add a new Individual, you will have the chance to fill in a lot of information.  Do not get too worried, just add what you know.  You can always edit or add more information later.  
</p><p>To help with consistency and aid the user, some fields may be filled in for you.  Like the last name of a child in a family, or the gender if you selected
"Add a son", "Add a daughter" or the like.  But you can change any of the information even if pre-filled in. You can also leave blank any information that is not known.
</p><p>Generally, a person is minimally defined by their name.  Often the gender and maybe one basic event of their life is known as well.  The three basic events are:
</p>
<ul><li>Birth</li>
<li>Marriage</li>
<li>Death</li></ul>
<p>Note that to add a marriage, you have to add a spouse. The marriage even is actually stored with the family and not the individuals.
</p><p>Having finished one person, you can proceed to the next person in the family. However, it is likely that you have more <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Facts_and_Events&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Facts and Events (page does not exist)">Facts and Events</a> on the life of the person, like place of residence, religion, education, etc. You can add this data now as well or come back and do it later.
</p><p>A <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Editing_Families&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Editing Families (page does not exist)">Family</a> is created automatically when you add a spouse, parent or child. Just as with an individual, you can add facts, events, and multimedia to the family.  Such information will be displayed in the Family screen and with each spouse.  A key fact with any family is the Marriage.  Another might be a census giving the family members, occupation, and residence.  Note that you can add a Marriage when in the Individuals screen.  But that fact is actually stored with the family.  Something to keep in mind when wondering why your edit disappeared after saving (because it appears staged as an edit waiting for approval with the family and not the individual).
</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Adding_Sources_and_Repositories">Adding Sources and Repositories</span></h3>
<p>As you become more accomplished, you will appreciate the concept of sources.  Every fact in the database can be attributed with a link to where you got that information from along with the details in the source reference.  The name, birth, death and so on are all facts that can be sourced from many places. If you can, get in the habit of ALWAYS adding a source to every fact, event or even name and Individual.  Many a time you come back six months later, see something that now seems incorrect, but wonder where you got that notion from.  Genealogy is more a constant refining process where you develop better and better educated guesses until you feel you have overwhelming evidence to support just one answer.  This happens with every fact -- the name, birth date, birth place and so on.  So while it may appear as a tedious task, adding sources pays later.
</p><p>You can add a source in the <i>Sources</i> tab on the individual display, and on virtually every fact and object editing screen - whether you are adding or editing new people, events, multimedia etc. The 'Sources' tab is appropriate for sources of a general nature relating to the person. If the source applies to the specific fact, event, image etc, it is better to note the source there.  And it is just fine to create a use a source that simply identifies it as an attestation by a specific individual.  At least you know where it came from in case you need to reconfirm later or decide which source wins out when conflicting.
</p><p>Sources can be linked to a repository as well.  So the source may be your family bible while the repository is a particular household or family that holds the bible.  Or the source may be a particular book and the repository a library where you found the book.  Get in the habit of listing the repository as well, even if your own collection.  Like sources attached to facts, you will not remember later on where you had seen that important document you forgot to make a photo copy of. Leave a breadcrumb to find that trail later.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Adding_Multimedia">Adding Multimedia</span></h3>
<p>You can illustrate your family data with a rich selection of Multimedia: images, voice and video, documents, webpages and other illustrative and documentary material. You can illustrate your sources with images of original documents, and include the complete works - stories, memoirs, biographies, as well as links to external sources and pages.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Enriching_the_viewing_experience">Enriching the viewing experience</span></h3>
<p>After entering a number of people in the family, it is time to think of enriching the viewer's experience. There are many items that make viewing the family tree more enjoyable:

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_User_Functions">The User Functions</span></h2>
<p>Once you have some data in your family tree, you are ready to show them to the users. This section desribes the basic operations the user - either visitor or registered user - can do to find what she wants on the webtrees page. The webtrees page should be mostly self-explanatory, but there is a lot of functionality under the hood. The user will want to <b>Navigate</b> the tree to find the information she is interested in, to <b>Search</b> if navigation does not get her there, and possibly to <b>Get data</b> - either as a printed report/page to show somebody without a computer, or possibly in an electronic form. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Navigate">Navigate</span></h3>
<p>webtrees has a very powerful navigation functions, which allow you to move easily between different persons, families and branches of the Family Tree. You can start with a Person, and navigate using this person nearest relatives, a chart of descendants, a chart of ancestors or a chart that includes both. webtrees also extensively uses Lists, which are "live", allowing you to filter, sort, select and jump to another list. 
</p><p>The <i>Charts</i> and <i>Lists</i> appear twice on the user interface: in the Top menu, and repeated for the Individual. The Top menu Charts by default start with the designated <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Pedigree_Chart_Root_Person&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Pedigree Chart Root Person (page does not exist)"> root person of the family tree</a>, configurable for each registered user. The Individual menu charts start with the individual. The Top menu lists are global, the Individual menu lists start with the individual or his family. 
</p><p>The genealogy data is often represented as a tree, but one can construct two very different trees, each with an individual at its root. The <b>Ancestry tree</b> shows  the individual and two parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, sixteen great-great-grandparents etc. The <b>Descendancy tree</b> shows an individual, all his/her children, all grandchildren etc.  
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Charts">Charts</span></h4>
<p><a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Charts&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Charts (page does not exist)">Charts</a> can be used as excellent navigation tools, with many options. Start with the <b>Hourglass</b> chart, which combines the <i>Ancestry</i> with <i>Descendancy</i> views, centered around you or the chosen individual. This gives you the nearest family neighborhood, with more people than the Close Relatives tab. The <b>Pedigree</b> chart extends towards the ancestors, and is similar to the <b>Ancestry</b> chart except for the layout. The <b>Descendancy</b> chart has the same layout as <i>Ancestry</i> but extends towards individual's descendants. The <b>Family Book</b> chart displays descendant families, each arranged in an <i>Hourglass</i> layout. You can achieve similar effect of displaying separate families in the <i>Ancestry</i> and <i>Descendancy</i> charts by selecting the "Booklet" option. The <b>Relationship</b> chart shows all individuals on the way between two individuals; The Relationship charts from the individual to the user favorites are pre-defined.</p><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><a href="./index.php%3Ftitle=Special:Upload&amp;wpDestFile=Sub_Diagrams.png.html" class="new" title="File:Sub Diagrams.png">File:Sub Diagrams.png</a>  <div class="thumbcaption">Example sub-menu</div></div></div>
<p>All those <i>standard</i> charts have common navigation tools. The Zoom  <a href="./index.php%3Ftitle=Special:Upload&amp;wpDestFile=Zoom.png.html" class="new" title="File:Zoom.png">File:Zoom.png</a>  icon expands the individual box, showing his/her life details. The Link to charts  &#160;<a href="./index.php%3Ftitle=Special:Upload&amp;wpDestFile=Link_to_charts.png.html" class="new" title="File:Link to charts.png">File:Link to charts.png</a>&#160;  icon shows a sub-menu of various charts for the individual and related persons, and the Arrow  <a href="./index.php%3Ftitle=Special:Upload&amp;wpDestFile=Arrow.png.html" class="new" title="File:Arrow.png">File:Arrow.png</a> pointing in different directions moves the display in the direction indicated, and in some contexts also displays a submenu if the destination is ambiguous. A plus or minus sign <a href="./index.php%3Ftitle=Special:Upload&amp;wpDestFile=PlusMinus.png.html" class="new" title="File:PlusMinus.png">File:PlusMinus.png</a> expands or contract parts of the tree.
</p><p>Other diagrams present the data in different graphic formats. The <b>Circle</b> diagram gives a snapshot of several generations of ancestors, with individual in the center. The <b>Compact</b> chart crams the individual and his/her ancestors up to great great grandparents (with optional images) in one compact page. There are two diagrams showing people and events as they develop in time. The <b>Timeline</b> chart shows all <i>events</i> of one (or more) individuals on a timeline. The <b>Lifespan</b> chart compares multiple <i>individuals</i>, with their events shown with small markers. Once selected, you can switch between those two views. In each diagram you can also navigate to the individual by clicking his/her name.

<p><a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Lists&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lists (page does not exist)">Lists</a>, like charts, can also be used as live navigation tools. Lists, especially lists of people and families,  show up in multiple locations, and almost all lists are connected. For example, viewing a list of people, you can click on the place name, which will bring you to the place hierarchy display with people and families related to this place; if you click at the date, you will be brought to the anniversary calendar with lists of events that occurred on this date (month, year, etc.). all list have column headers that can be clicked to sort the rows alphabetically; the people list have additional options to sort by first name, and to add parents.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="People_and_families_2">People and families</span></h5>
<p>Lists of people and families are displayed in many places: when the "<a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Family_List&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Family List (page does not exist)">Family List</a>" and "<a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Individual_List&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Individual List (page does not exist)">Individual List</a>" menu items are selected; as a result of a search; in the "On This Day" and "Upcoming Events" boxes; as lists of people and families linked to a particular Source or Media object; as lists of people and families related to the selected Place location etc.
People lists share the header that allows you to filter and select people based on a range of criteria:

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Using any one of those filters you can narrow the list of choices. Clicking the person or family will navigate to this person (family) display. Selecting the place or date will bring the Place Hierarchy or Anniversary lists.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Place_Hierarchy">Place Hierarchy</span></h5>
<p>If places in your GEDCOM are structured (see <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Place_data&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Place data (page does not exist)">Place data</a> for details), the Place Hierarchy list will display the list of top level place elements. They typically should be country names, although in some not-so-distant future they could be "Earth", "Moon", "Mars" etc. When you click on any such element, you will be presented with a list of its sub-elements, for example States if the country was US. The sub-list will be accompanied by a map, if available. You can continue to lower level sub-units (Counties, etc.), or select "View all records found in this place". You will eventually see a list of people and families. Birth, Death and Marriage places are listed, but the name will show in this list if the place is mentioned with any event. 
</p><p>As always, clicking the person/family opens this person/family screen, clicking the place opens another another list of all people/families associated with this place etc.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Multimedia">Multimedia</span></h5>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=MultiMedia_List&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="MultiMedia List (page does not exist)">MultiMedia List</a> menu item will display the list of Media Objects. You can use the "Filter" function to search for media that have the selected phrase in the title. The Objects returned usually include thumbnail, and also a list of people/families it is associated with. You can navagate to any of them by clicking the name.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Sources_and_Repositories">Sources and Repositories</span></h5>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Source_List&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Source List (page does not exist)">Source List</a> and <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Repository_List&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Repository List (page does not exist)">Repository List</a> display the sources and repositories found in your Gedcom respectively. They do not currently have any filtering tools. If you click on a source, you will be brought to the source screen, with its details and a list of people for which this source is cited. If you click on a repository, you will see a the depository details and a list of sources in this repository.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Calendar">Calendar</span></h4>
<p>The Anniversary Calendar will display the anniversaries occuring on a specific day, month or year. It will show lists of people and families, and for each the events that match the selection criteria. The list will show events (selectable in the "Show events" option) and also indicate, which anniversary it is, relative to the selected year (which may not be the current year). Only "positive" anniversaries are shown, i.e. the screen will only show events that occurred before (or in) the selected year,. For example if your anniversary date is March 1780, and you are displaying months, events that occurred in all Marches before 1780 will be shown. 
</p>
<div class="center"><div class="thumb tnone"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><a href="./index.php%3Ftitle=Special:Upload&amp;wpDestFile=Anniversary_Calendar.png.html" class="new" title="File:Anniversary Calendar.png">File:Anniversary Calendar.png</a>  <div class="thumbcaption"></div></div></div></div>
<p>You can select Day, Month or Year from the menu, or switch using the "View Day", "View Month" and "View Year" options on the screen. 
</p>
<ul><li><b>View Day</b> will display events that occurred <i>this day of this month in any year</i>.</li>
<li><b>View Month</b> will display events that occurred <i>any day of this month in any year</i>.</li>
<li><b>View Year</b> will display events that occurred <i>any day of any month in this year</i>.</li></ul>
<p>For example, if you want to find all events that occurred on February 29, you need to first select a leap year (latest leap year if you want all events, for example 2008), then click on February and finally on the 29th.
</p><p>The screen has other useful functionality. You can select all people, living people or limit the range to the last 100 years (the "Show" option). You can select the gender (all, men, women) and select the events that are to be shown (All, Births, Deaths and Marriages and a selection from more common events).
</p><p>You can also select different calendars. The events that occurred on a specific date may have an anniversary on different dates in  the Julian, Jewish or Islamic calendars. Due to different calendar rules, the determination of the anniversary may only be approximate (typically the difference does not exceed one day).
</p><p>As with all lists, clicking on person's name (or family names) opens this person or family screen. Conversely, clicking on a date,  month or year in any other lists brings this anniversary calendar focused on the selected date, month or year.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Close_relatives">Close relatives</span></h4>
<p>When you click the "Close relatives" tab on the individual display, you will switched to a screen showing the individual's family in which he or she is a child, and the family in which he or she is a spouse. You can navigate to parents and siblings, as well as to the families listed on this display.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Search">Search</span></h3>
<p>webtrees has a powerful search facility, which can be accessed for a quick search through a <b>Search box</b>, and via the <b>Search menu</b>.  The Search box does the same search as the General Search item in the <i>Search menu</i>, but with all <i>Search for</i> options and all <i>Databases</i> selected.  
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="General">General</span></h4>
<p>The General Search allows you to search for almost anything - names, places, dates, fragments of text, etc. There are some caveats - dates must be entered in their English abbreviated form (e.g. <i>12 Jan 1817</i>) and you can use regular expressions if you know how. The search is not case sensitive, and wildcards are assumed - the search term will be found no matter what precedes or follows it. The options are:
</p>
<dl><dt>Search For</dt>
<dd>You can check one or more of the following
<ul><li>Individual Names.  Actually this should say Individuals - this option searches the Individual Records for the text string you entered</li>
<li>Family Names.  As above, it searches Family Records fro the search string</li>
<li>Sources - will search Sources for the term you specified</li></ul></dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Exclude Filter</dt>
<dd>Excludes some non-genealogical data by default, you can turn it off.</dd>
<dt>Associates</dt>
<dd>Includes records of <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Adding_an_Associate&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Adding an Associate (page does not exist)">associates</a> in the search.</dd>
<dt>Database to search in</dt>
<dd>select the Gedcom to search for, if there is more than one.</dd></dl>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Soundex">Soundex</span></h4>
<p>Soundex should return search results even if the spelling is not exact. You can use Basic type, but the 
Daitch-Mokotoff is more efficient in finding close matches, and only this type works for non-English search terms. Of course, the Soundex search may return more results than needed, but it is more likely to find what  are you looking for. The search terms can be entered as  <b>Given name</b>, <b>Last name</b>, or <b>Place</b>, and modified by selecting a <b>Year</b>.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Get_data">Get data</span></h3>
<p>In addition to viewing the Family Tree on thew ebpage, you may need to extract some data to work on them off-line. Typically this would include the printed or printable form to be distributed on paper or included in a family book or other publication, and raw data for further manipulation, creating tables or extracts or importing to other programs. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Printable_data">Printable data</span></h4>
<p>You can print any webtrees page using your browsers 'PRINT' command; there is also a menu item called "Reports", devoted to generation of reports in printable form. 
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Reports">Reports</span></h5>
<p>You can select from an array of reports in the Reports menu. For each report you have some options to select, and they can be delivered as HTML (i.e. on the webpage) or as a downloadable pdf file (you need a pdf reader to open the file). You can select family tree reports (Individual, Family, Descendants, Ancestors, etc.), some genealogical information information lists (Marriages, Deaths, Births etc.), as well as other lists like recent changes or address lists.
</p><p>You can <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Create_custom_report&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Create custom report (page does not exist)">create your own report</a> to be included in the menu. See also the list of <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=XML_Report_Templates&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="XML Report Templates (page does not exist)">XML report templates</a> you can use.
</p><p>Please note that the Address reports currently show only addresses attached to the individual and family records, not addresses in the Residence facts.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Charts_2">Charts</span></h5>
<p>Often a better option to produce a printable version of some section of the family tree is to use the Charts menu. You can tune up your chart using its options, and then select the "Printer friendly version" at the bottom of the page to clean up the display. You can print the result or use a pdf printer driver (for example Open Source <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/">PDF Creator</a>) to create the pdf file.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Electronic_form">Electronic form</span></h4>
<p>If you have Administrator privileges, you can <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Manage_GEDCOMs_and_edit_privacy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Manage GEDCOMs and edit privacy (page does not exist)">download</a> the complete Gedcom together with the media. Other user categories can use the <b>Family Clippings Cart</b> to pack into a file a selection of data they can access, if this option is enabled by the administrator.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Family_Tree_Clippings_Cart">Family Tree Clippings Cart</span></h5>
<p>If allowed by the site administrator, you view an individual, a family or a source, in the <i>Other</i> menu you can access an <i>Add to Clippings Cart</i> submenu. It serves as a method of exporting a portion of the family tree and accessing this tool will present you with a list of options to add just this item or expand the selection by adding other relations or, in case of sources, records of all people and families quoting this source. If the site manager has so configured it, users may also reach the Clippings cart from the main menu. 
</p><p>You can keep adding items to your cart until you are ready - the content of the cart will be preserved between sessions. The cart will show the list of items, you can also remove unwanted ones. When you are ready, you can download the file which will contain the family tree file for the referenced individuals (a gedcom) with all selected items, plus associated media files, if you selected that option.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Admin_approval">Admin approval</span></h3>
<p>Your editing status depends on the Administrator policy, and may vary depending on installation. Typically you can edit your own data, and need editing privileges to edit others. 
</p><p>The site administrator controls the approval of changes made to the site.  On a new installation, the approval process is set to pending for ALL users -- including the administrator.  This means the changes you make are not immediately visible to other users. They are marked on the page as changes, pending approval by the Administrator. 
</p><p>There are several access levels for people that can review and approve (accept) or decline (deny) others' edits. This process of displaying pending changes is not yet perfect, and some entities are not visible: for example creating a new Source does not display it, and if you did not happen to write down the source ID, you must wait for approval in order to proceed. 
</p><p>If the web site is configured with the PENDING CHANGES block on the home page, after any changes are made, an email is sent to admin informing the admin of edits to the database. The email is not repeated until 24 hours passes (lest each editing session would create a spam). The administrator approval process is described in a separate article, see <a href="../Accept_/_Reject_Changes.html" title="Accept / Reject Changes">Accept / Reject Changes</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gedcom_data_structure">Gedcom data structure</span></h3>
<p>The data model as well as file storage in webtrees is based on <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=GEDCOM&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="GEDCOM (page does not exist)">GEDCOM</a> standard. There are many resources detailing the structure, the meaning of Gedcom Tags and usage, including the draft Gedcom standard that is the base of webtrees model. webtrees is very flexible in using the model, and allows files with significant departures from the model to be processed. The <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Verify_Gedcom_File&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Verify Gedcom File (page does not exist)">verification</a> procedure can check your Gedcom file for strict and lax conformance with Gedcom standard.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_rules">Basic rules</span></h3>
<p>In working with genealogy data you must remember to always verify, document, write down the sources. Memory is fragile, and years later you will not know if the error was in original source or just sloppy data entry.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Common_Elements">Common Elements</span></h3>
<p>In entering Events and Facts you fill data fields, some of which are the common to most entries. In describing and Event, <b>Date</b> and <b>Place</b> are considered most important, and have their special rules for entering data: see the articles on <b><a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Dates&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Dates (page does not exist)">Dates</a></b> and <b><a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Place_data&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Place data (page does not exist)">Places</a></b>. Other entries that you will frequently encounter are <b>Type</b>, <b>Address</b>, <b>Associate</b>, <b>Source Citation</b>, <b>Restriction</b>, <b>Agency</b> and <b>Note</b>. All those elements are useful and add valuable structure to the data,  you should take advantage of them if possible.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="People">People</span></h3>
<p>In the heart of genealogy are people and their pedigree. Pedigree, according to Webster (<i>Middle English pedegru, from Anglo-French pé de grue, literally, crane's foot; from the shape made by the lines of a genealogical chart</i>) is defined as an ancestral line. Adding, modifying and deleting people and their links in families creating the ancestral lines is described in two main articles.
</p><p>Also at the heart of genealogy are the family relationships between people. Whereas information about a specific person is contained in his individual record, relationships are handled by family (FAM) records. FAM records describe one family: usually husband, wife, and children. An individual record typically contains a FAMC pointer to the FAM record where the person is a child, and a FAMS pointer to the family where that person is a husband or wife. With these two fundamental relationships, all other relationships are derived.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts_and_Events">Facts and Events</span></h3>
<p>To give life to people and famiy data in your database, you add facts and events. The terminology is a little confused; Gedcom standard talks about <i>Events</i> like Birth, Baptism, Graduation, etc. with a generic "Event", and about <i>Attributes</i> sometimes called <i>Facts</i> like Education, Occupation or Residence with a generic "Fact". The conceptual difference is that <i>Events</i> occur at a definite point in time (the point may extend as far as a day), while <i>Facts</i> are either extended in time (e.g Education), or don't have a specific time attached to them (e.g Number of Children). webtrees does not treat the Facts and Events differently, and allows you to add Facts and Events to an individual or family by selecting from a list of possibilities. The Administator can customize this list, adding and removing both individual and family entries, as well as „Quick Add'” items available with a single click. If you don't see here what you need, ask the administrator to add it.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Editing_raw_Gedcom_record">Editing raw Gedcom record</span></h3>
<p>Each <a href="https://wiki.webtrees.net/en/w/index.php?title=Gedcom_data_structure&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Gedcom data structure (page does not exist)">top level record</a> (individual, family, object, source and repository) has its own Gedcom fragment that you can view and edit. In a perfect world, all editing should be possible trough user interface, but who has seen perfect software? Also, imported Gedcom may contain errors or non-standard tags that webtrees does not understand, and errors could also be introduced by webtrees as well. Of course this should not happen, but who has seen software completely free from bugs?
</p><p>
The Gedcom record has a simple structure, each line starting with a number that indicates the level: after a tag with level 1, subsequent tag level 2 indicates that it is subordinate to the level one tag. For example if the event is Birth (1 BIRT), Date (2 DAT) applies to Birth, Time (3 TIME) applies to Date, and Place (2 PLAC) applies to Birth:   </p><pre>1 BIRT
2 DATE 11 NOV 1825
3 TIME 23:55
2 PLAC Greenwood...
</pre><p>
The tags are always 3 or 4 capital letters, and are separated by space from level number and from subsequent value of the tag (if any). If a tag is missing, is in the wrong place, or the user interface does not supply the value you seek, you can correct it by editing the Gedcom fragment. For example, if the Media Object you are adding is a painting, and the user interface offers only <i>photo</i> as the type of the file (no photography before 1827 or so&#160;:-(, you can look at the raw Gedcom fragment: </p><pre>0 @<a href="../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="591461606e19">[email&#160;protected]</a> OBJE
1 FILE media/Aunt_Matilda.jpg
2 FORM JPG
3 TYPE photo</pre>
<p>and change the line <i>3 TYPE photo</i> to <i>3 TYPE painting</i>.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Privacy">Privacy</span></h2>
<p>As a user you are possibly concerned with privacy. While it is a responsibility of an Administrator to set the privacy policies, it is useful to know, what options are available. You may wonder whether your personal data will be visible to everybody, and may also encounter restrictions on what you can see. <b>webtrees</b> has very detailed privacy rules which can restrict viewing and /or editing of specific event types, specific events, selected people, people not related to you or only distantly related etc.
